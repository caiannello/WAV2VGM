These examples are made using the same additive sine method
as before, but I was much more careful about utilizing all 
18 channels of the OPL3. They sound way less bloopy, but what 
the heck is that crackling sound? I don't know yet.

Anyway, these can be generated from the utility by first 
pushing M, for Manual mode, and waiting a while for the graph 
to appear. This graph shows the original spectra in white, 
overlaid with the synthesized spectra in red. These graphs can 
be scrolled through using the arrow keys. 

(The actual VGM file is made/played by pressing P while in this 
mode.)
